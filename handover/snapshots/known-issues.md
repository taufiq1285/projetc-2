# KNOWN ISSUES & SOLUTIONS - WEEK 1 SNAPSHOT

## 🟢 RESOLVED ISSUES

### **1. Repository Security (CRITICAL - RESOLVED)**
**Issue:** Repository was initially set to PUBLIC, exposing sensitive data
**Impact:** HIGH - Supabase credentials and database schema were public
**Resolution:** 
- ✅ Repository set to PRIVATE
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured in .gitignore
- ✅ .env.example created with safe template
- ✅ Credentials regenerated in Supabase
**Preventive Measures:**
- All .env files in .gitignore
- Regular security audits scheduled
- Credential rotation policy established

### **2. TypeScript Path Aliases (RESOLVED)**
**Issue:** Import paths were inconsistent and relative
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Code maintainability and readability
**Resolution:**
- ✅ Configured @ path alias in tsconfig.json and vite.config.ts
- ✅ All imports use absolute paths (@/components, @/hooks, etc.)
- ✅ Path aliases documented in established patterns
**Verification:** All existing code uses consistent import patterns

### **3. Supabase Connection Testing (RESOLVED)**
**Issue:** Initial database connection reliability concerns
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Development confidence
**Resolution:**
- ✅ Comprehensive connection test suite implemented
- ✅ All 16 RBAC tests passing (100% success rate)
- ✅ CRUD operations verified and functional
- ✅ RLS policies active and tested
**Ongoing:** Health check monitoring in place

### **5. PWA Store Integration TypeScript Errors (RESOLVED)**
**Issue:** TypeScript compilation errors in PWA files due to undefined store methods
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Blocked PWA development and functionality
**Errors Fixed:**
- ✅ Error 2339: Property 'notify' does not exist on type 'NotificationStore' (4 instances)
- ✅ Error 2339: Property 'showInfoModal' does not exist on type 'UIStore' (2 instances)
- ✅ Error 6133: Unused import 'modal' declared but never used
**Root Cause:**
- PWA utility files were accessing store methods that don't exist yet
- Direct store dependencies created coupling between PWA and incomplete stores
- Incomplete migration to self-contained approach left unused dependencies
**Resolution Strategy:**
- ✅ Implemented complete self-contained systems for PWA functionality
- ✅ Created SimpleNotification interface for offline notifications (console + browser)
- ✅ Removed unused modal dependencies, direct alert() fallback for install instructions
- ✅ PWA functionality now works independently of store implementation
- ✅ Documented store integration guidelines for future enhancement
**Final Implementation:**
- ✅ `src/lib/pwa/offline.ts`: Complete self-contained notification system
- ✅ `src/lib/pwa/install.ts`: Direct browser API usage, no store dependencies
- ✅ Store Integration Guidelines: Pattern for safe store enhancement
- ✅ Complete TypeScript cleanup: No unused variables or dead code
**Benefits:**
- PWA works immediately without waiting for complete store implementation
- Graceful degradation if stores have errors or are incomplete
- Clear separation between PWA logic and store logic
- Can enhance with full store integration in Week 2-3 without breaking existing functionality
**Verification:**
- TypeScript compilation: CLEAN (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- PWA functionality: Fully operational without store dependencies
- Install instructions: Working with alert-based fallbacks
- Future enhancement: Clear path for store integration documented
**Issue:** TypeScript compilation errors in PWA notifications system
**Impact:** HIGH - Blocked development and build process

- ✅ Error 6196: Unused type declarations (BeforeInstallPromptEvent)
**Resolution:**
- ✅ Created ExtendedNotificationOptions interface with self-contained types
- ✅ Implemented consistent object type structure for union type safety
- ✅ Fixed import hygiene by removing unused dependencies
- ✅ Added comprehensive PWA type definitions (src/types/pwa.ts)
- ✅ Implemented feature detection and graceful fallbacks
- ✅ Fixed VAPID key conversion with proper type casting
- ✅ Maintained browser compatibility with modern features
**Learning Strategy:**
- ✅ Documented error prevention patterns for future development
- ✅ Created TypeScript error prevention checklist
- ✅ Established debugging strategies for common error types
- ✅ Implemented self-contained type definition pattern to avoid import issues
**Verification:** 
- TypeScript compilation: CLEAN (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- Browser compatibility: Verified across modern browsers
- PWA functionality: Fully operational
- Code quality: ESLint passing, consistent patterns

## 🟡 MONITORING ISSUES

### **1. Bundle Size Optimization (MONITORING)**

**Dependencies Contributing to Size:**
- React Query v5: ~45KB
- Zustand: ~8KB
- React Hook Form: ~25KB
- Tailwind CSS: Variable (purged in production)
- Supabase JS: ~35KB
**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Tree shaking enabled in Vite
- Dynamic imports planned for role-specific pages
- PWA caching reduces repeat downloads
**Action Required:** Monitor during Week 2 development

### **2. Database Query Performance (MONITORING)**
**Issue:** Potential N+1 queries with complex RBAC checks
**Current Status:** ACCEPTABLE for current scale
**Risk Areas:**
- Permission checking with nested resources
- Audit log queries with large datasets
- Real-time subscriptions with multiple tables
**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Permission caching implemented (15-30min TTL)
- Database indexes planned for Week 2
- Query optimization patterns established
**Action Required:** Performance testing during Week 2

### **3. PWA Cache Size Management (MONITORING)**
**Issue:** Cache size could grow large with user data
**Current Status:** GOOD - 50MB limit with cleanup
**Risk Factors:**
- Equipment images and documents
- User-generated content
- Offline queue accumulation
**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Automatic cache cleanup every 10 minutes
- TTL-based expiration (5min-24hr based on category)
- Manual cache clear options for users
- Storage quota monitoring
**Action Required:** Monitor cache metrics in Week 2
