markdown# WEEK 2 PRIORITIES - UI FOUNDATION & BASIC PAGES

## üéØ OVERVIEW
**Focus:** UI Component Library + Basic Page Structure  
**Timeline:** Days 7-14 (Week 2)  
**Goal:** Complete foundational UI system for all roles  

## üöÄ HIGH PRIORITY (MUST COMPLETE)

### **Day 7: Core UI Components**

 TypeScript strict mode compliance
 Integration with UI store (loading, theme)
 44px minimum touch targets (mobile-first)

Day 8: Layout Components
typescript1. Header Component (Navigation, user menu)
2. Sidebar Component (Role-based navigation)
3. Layout Component (Page wrapper with sidebar)
4. Breadcrumb Component (Navigation tracking)
5. Loading Component (Skeleton screens)
Day 9: Form Components
typescript1. Form Component (React Hook Form integration)
2. Select Component (Dropdown with search)
3. Checkbox Component (With indeterminate state)
4. Radio Group Component (Multiple options)
5. File Upload Component (Drag & drop)

2. Pagination Component (Page navigation)
3. Search Component (Real-time filtering)
4. Filter Component (Advanced filtering)
5. Empty State Component (No data scenarios)
Day 11-12: Basic Pages Structure
typescript// Create basic page templates for all roles
1. Dashboard template (role-agnostic)
2. List page template (with table, search, filters)

5. Settings page template (user preferences)
Day 13-14: Authentication & Navigation
typescript1. Login page (with form validation)
2. Role-based routing setup
3. Navigation guard implementation
4. Route protection testing
5. Basic dashboard content
üîÑ MEDIUM PRIORITY (SHOULD COMPLETE)
Error Handling System

Error boundary implementation
Global error state management
User-friendly error messages
Error logging to console

Performance Foundation

Bundle size monitoring setup
Component lazy loading preparation
Image optimization strategy
Performance metrics baseline

Accessibility Baseline

ARIA labels for all interactive elements
Keyboard navigation support
Focus management in modals
Color contrast verification

üîç LOW PRIORITY (NICE TO HAVE)
Development Experience

Storybook setup for component documentation
Component testing framework setup
ESLint rules refinement
Prettier configuration optimization

UI Enhancements

Dark mode toggle implementation
Custom CSS animations
Micro-interactions for buttons
Toast notification styling

üìã WEEK 2 SUCCESS METRICS
Component Library (Target: 20 components)

 UI Components: 5 core components
 Layout Components: 5 structure components
 Form Components: 5 input components
 Data Components: 5 display components

Page Foundation (Target: 5 templates)

 Dashboard: Role-agnostic layout
 List: Data display with actions
 Detail: Single item view
 Form: Create/edit interface
 Auth: Login/logout flow

Integration Testing

 All components work together
 State management integration
 RBAC integration working
 Mobile responsiveness verified
 TypeScript compilation clean

üö® RISK MITIGATION
Potential Blockers

Component Complexity: Keep components simple, add features later
Mobile Responsiveness: Test on actual devices early
State Integration: Use established patterns from Week 1
Performance: Monitor bundle size daily

Fallback Plans

If components too complex: Use simpler versions initially
If mobile issues: Focus on mobile-first development
If state issues: Reference Week 1 established patterns
If performance issues: Implement lazy loading immediately

üéØ WEEK 2 DELIVERABLES
By End of Week 2:

Complete UI Component Library (20 components)
Basic Page Templates (5 templates)
Authentication Flow (Login/logout)
Role-based Navigation (4 role menus)
Mobile-Responsive Design (All components)

Quality Gates:

‚úÖ TypeScript compilation: 0 errors
‚úÖ All components responsive on mobile
‚úÖ RBAC integration working
‚úÖ Performance baseline established
‚úÖ Documentation updated

Week 2 Target: 40% overall project completion
Foundation: Complete UI system ready for role-specific features
Next: Week 3-4 focus on role-specific pages and business logic
